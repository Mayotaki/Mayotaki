## 🐾 About Me

Hi, I'm Mayotaki, and I'm passionate about programming. I mainly work with **Git** and **Python**, and I enjoy using these tools to solve different problems. 

My programming journey started with learning the basics of development, and now I'm becoming more and more interested in **DevOps**. I have experience with Unix systems and enjoy automating processes and optimizing workflows. 

I am always open to new knowledge and willing to experiment with different technologies. When not programming, I like to spend time with friends doing something fun or just enjoying a good movie.

If you have ideas for projects or want to socialize, don't hesitate to get in touch! Always excited for new acquaintances and opportunities. 😊
